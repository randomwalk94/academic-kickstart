My advisor is [Alexei Novikov](https://www.math.psu.edu/~anovikov/). My interests cover topics in partial differential equations and probability, stochastic PDE, etc. 

At the moment, I investigate the long time behavior of a Hamiltonian system driven by slowly decorrelating noise. Some early works were done by Freidlin, Wentzell, Papanicolaou, etc.

### Notes

These include conference notes, research notes, or any significant notes that I want to write down to better understand the materials. Every note will have a respective blog post; I will sometimes $\LaTeX$ the notes for convenience. Mistakes are unavoidable, but I will write anyway.
