1\. Reeb graph, Hamiltonian. It was shown that the non-Markovian processes $\Gamma(X_t^{x,\varepsilon})$ converge in distribution, as $\varepsilon\to 0$ to a disffusion on the graph. Reeb:
`\[\Gamma: \mathcal{T}\to G, \quad \Gamma(x)=(i,|H(x)|)\;\text{if }x\in \bar U_i. \]`

2\. (Pertubed test function) To prove tightness of a sequence of processes $\{x^{\varepsilon}(\cdot)\}$, we define an operator ${\hat A}{}^{\varepsilon}$ on $x^{\varepsilon}$ which has properties similar to those of an infinitesimal operator of a Markov process. If $A$ is the operator for the limit process $x(\cdot)$, we can then compare ${\hat A}{}^{\varepsilon}f^{\varepsilon}(\cdot)$ with $Af(x^{\varepsilon}(\cdot))$, where $f^{\varepsilon}(\cdot)$ is an appropriate small perturbation of $f(\cdot)$. Under some suitable conditions, if ${\hat A}{}^{\varepsilon}f^{\varepsilon}(\cdot)-Af(x^{\varepsilon}(\cdot))\to 0$ for all smooth $f$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$, then $x^{\varepsilon}(\cdot)$ will converge (weakly) to $x(\cdot)$.
