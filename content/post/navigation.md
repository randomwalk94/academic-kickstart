The website is written in the framework of a blog. Except for the main pages, every post will be included in the [Posts](/post) page. Every main page has its own responsibility:

**Page** | **Responsibility**
--- | ---
[PERSONAL](/personal) | Maintains the list of non-academic blog posts (on my personal life, etc.)
[POSTS](/post) | The list of all blog posts.
[RESEARCH](/research) | Contains materials related to my research activities.
[TEACHING](/teaching) | Contains teaching materials, teaching tips.
[RESOURCES](/resources) | Tutorials/tips/tricks on different topics (both in academia and non-academia). Maintains links to other useful websites.
[OPPORTUNITIES](/opportunities) | Maintains my travel agenda and the list of other academic events.
[CONTACT](/#contact) | How to get to me.

Each post has the comment section powered by [Disqus](http://disq.us/). Unfortunately, Disqus no longer provides support for Mathjax so $\LaTeX$ cannot be used in comments.

There is the [Tag](/#tag) section on the the front page of the website.
