This post is a collection of materials that are related to the KPZ equation. It is, in any measure, not complete. I just want to have a good repository of references on the subject. Also, it is a way for me to organize knowledge.

Instead of listing 

## Introduction


## Regularity Structures
The purpose of regularity structures, introduced in [Hai14] and motivated by [Lyo98,
Gub04], is to generalise Taylor expansions using essentially arbitrary functions/distributions
instead of polynomials.

### Rough path results in regularity structures framework
