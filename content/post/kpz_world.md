This post is just a collection of materials that are related to the KPZ equation. It is, in any measure, not complete. I want to have a good repository of references on the subject. Also, it is a way for me to organize knowledge. 

An unordered list of mathematicians appearing in the field (which is _almost surely_ incomplete, updated as time goes forward; for quick referencing):
