This post is a collection of materials that are related to the KPZ equation. It is, in any measure, not complete. I just want to have a good repository of references on the subject. Also, it is a way for me to organize knowledge.

## Introduction


## Regularity Structures
The purpose of regularity structures, introduced in [Hai14] and motivated by [Lyo98,
Gub04], is to generalise Taylor expansions using essentially arbitrary functions/distributions
instead of polynomials.

### Rough path results in regularity structures framework

### Presentation
Eden model is not symmetric with respect to the origin as the cells develop in biases in one direction. The direction that has more cells has more probability to grow more cells.  

So in Hairerâ€™s theory, a function is called smooth if locally it can be
approximated by the noise (and higher order terms constructed from the
noise). This induces a natural topology in which the solutions to semilinear
SPDEs depend continuously on the driving signal.

Outline:  

- Intro KPZ: IvanCorwin (Exactly SolveKPZ)/KPZ Universaltiy/IvanCorwin research statement
- Zambotti in conjunction with Hairer-Friz
- Brault $-$ $dy\_t = F(y\_t)dW\_t$
- Hairer Solving KPZ

Solving KPZ: the idea is to build a regularity structure that describes the KPZ, then using the reconstruction theorem to rebuild the distributions, which satisfy the normalized KPZ. Then show that it converge to the same limiting process independently of the choice of normalization.
