Website for the workshop: [Workshop III: Random Matrices and Free Probability Theory](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-iii-random-matrices-and-free-probability-theory/).

I will not (and cannot) cover everything that was presented at the conference. Here are some of the materials that I found useful and interesting.

## Brown measure

One first needs the framework of [free probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_probability). I have written down some notes about this subject in a [blog post](/post/free_probability).

## Wigner-Dyson-Mehta conjecture

## Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture

## Brownian motions on Lie groups
