Website for the workshop: [Workshop III: Random Matrices and Free Probability Theory](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-iii-random-matrices-and-free-probability-theory/).

I will not (and cannot) cover everything that was presented at the conference. Here are some of the materials that I found useful and interesting.

## Brown measure

One first needs the framework of [free probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_probability). I have written down some notes about this subject in a [blog post](/post/free_probability).

## Wigner-Dyson-Mehta conjecture

## Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture

## Brownian motions on Lie groups

A **Brownian motion** $(U_t)_{t\ge 0}$ on the unitary group $\mathbb U_N$ is a Markov process starting at $I_N$ whose **generator is the Laplacian** $\frac{1}{2}\delta_{\mathbb U_N}$ for a certain metric.

For other Lie groups: Levy (2011), Cébron, Kemp (2013), Ulrich (2015). For more general situations: Cébron (2016), Gabriel (2015). The set of trace polynomials has to be replaced by the set of traffic operations (in the sense of Camille Male).
