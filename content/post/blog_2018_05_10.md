I was sitting at the desk. The Airbnb host was really nice. He even let me use the washing machine for free. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. 

A great perk of being in grad school is having the opportunities to travel a lot, for FREE! This summer I was in my car most of the time, driving on Interstate highways and local roads.
