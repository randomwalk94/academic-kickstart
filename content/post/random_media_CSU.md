Website for the summer school: [Summer School Waves and Particles in Random Media: Theory and Applications](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~pinaud/SummerSchool/school.html).

The summer school was held on campus of Colorado State University in Fort Collins.

## Borcea  

Weak scattering regime in open environments. Stronger regimes require an in depth study of waves in random media.  

Coherent imaging: Transport mean free part-quantify the decay of the mean.  

CINT passive arrays. Model of random medium:
`\[\frac{1}{c^2(x)} = \frac{1}{c_0^2} \left[1+\sigma \mu\left(\frac{x}{l} \right) \right] \] `
