1\. (Sloppy formulation) There are two KPZ universality conjectures  

1. (_Weak KPZ universality conjecture_) For any tunable asymetric model (e.g ASEP with $\text{down}\to\text{up}$ probability $p$ and $\text{up}\to\text{down}$ probability $q$), let the asymmetry $a=p-q=\varepsilon^2\to 0$ and perform $1:2:4$ scaling, the model will converge to KPZ equation.
2. (_Strong KPZ universality conjecture_) For a large of growth models, performing $1:2:3$ scaling will converge to the _KPZ fixed point_.
