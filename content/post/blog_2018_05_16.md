I have been wanting to write _a lot_ of things for a long time, but there was no success whatsoever, partly because I was interrupted by my work at school, or simply because of laziness.

This website was created as I needed some place to showcase my academic achievments during my time in grad school at Penn State. Luckily, it has a well-designed blog framework, so I now have opportunities to write down my thoughts in a more convenient way. 

The title says the whole thing: _just write_! No matter how bad, unpolished, poor-organized, unpublishable you think your writing is, just find a place to jot down and publish it. That will be the philosophy I will impose on this website in general. What I have realized over the years is that you do your best work when you think nobody will ever see it. Of course, it will be a joy if someone actually congratulates on your writing, but you just want to write after all.
