Stochastic calculus is dedicated to the theory of _stochastic processes_. Just like classical calculus being the study of functions, stochastic calculus provides tools to operate on stochastic processes, which are in essence _random functions_.

Because $A_k$ and $\\{\sum\_{i=k+1}^n X\_i\ge 0 \\}$ are independent, the right-hand side becomes \[ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{W}) = \frac{1}{2s} \sum\_{n=1}^N \sum\_{m:r\_{mn} = 1} (y\_{mn} - \mathbf{x}_m\mathbf{w}\_n)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} ||\mathbf{W}||\_F^2 ~~~~~ (2) \]
