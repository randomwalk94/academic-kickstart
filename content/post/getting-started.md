This is the first post. Just want to test some $\LaTeX$:
\\[\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{1^s}+\frac{1}{2^s}+\ldots+\frac{1}{n^s}+\ldots\\]

My name is Hai Le \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\).
Let $M$ be the maximum of $u$ in $\bar \Omega$. We need to show that if $u(x\_0)=M$ for some $x\_0\in \Omega$ then $u$ is constant. Let ${S\_M} = \\{ x \in \Omega \;|\;u(x) = M\\} $. Since $u$ is continuous, $S\_M$ is relatively closed in $\Omega$. We will show that $S_M$ is also relatively open in $\Omega$, then $\Omega$ being connected will imply $S\_M=\Omega$. My name is Hai Viet Le \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\).

#### Google hghg

Google Adsense, a third party affiliate marketing network, uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants.

## Disclosure Policy

I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I'll get a percentage of that sale.

Currently I'm an affiliate for Amazon and Google Adsense.

What this means for you:

* I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
* I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
* I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
* I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.
