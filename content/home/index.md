# News

The website is going through a big update. I'm not teaching this semester.

# About 

I'm pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Penn State. The purpose of this website is to record my research activities, mathematical notes, teaching materials, and some tutorials. More information and how to navigate my website will be in the [Personal](/personal) page.

Favorite quote by [Paul ErdÅ‘s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) about [Ramsey numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory):

> Imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us landing on Earth and demanding the value of $R(5, 5)$ or they will destroy our planet. In that case, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they asked for $R(6, 6)$, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.
