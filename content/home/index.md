# News
My name is Hai Le. This page is still _under construction_; there is nothing to look at besides my CV yet. 

[Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) passed away on March 14, 2018. This is [tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrVVvXOIwQc) to him from Cambridge University.

# About 

I'm pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Penn State. This site includes my research activities, mathematical notes, teaching materials, and some tutorials. More information will be in the Personal tab.

Favorite quote by [Paul ErdÅ‘s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) about [Ramsey numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory):

> Imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us landing on Earth and demanding the value of $R(5, 5)$ or they will destroy our planet. In that case, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they asked for $R(6, 6)$, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.
